# DMCA Takedown Policy (Template)

This repository aims to contain only original, clean-room implementation code
and freely licensed documentation. It must **not** host Microsoft Windows
media/binaries or other infringing material.

This policy is a template for maintainers. It is not legal advice.

## Designated contact

Send takedown notices to:

- Email: `<dmca@your-domain.example>`
- Subject: `DMCA Takedown Notice - Aero`

If you cannot email, open a GitHub issue **only if** it does not require
posting copyrighted material publicly.

## Takedown notice requirements

To help us act quickly, include:

1. Your name and contact information (email + mailing address).
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.
3. Identification of the allegedly infringing material, with enough
   information for us to locate it (URL(s), commit hash, file path, etc.).
4. A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use is not
   authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
5. A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notice
   is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on
   the owner’s behalf.
6. A physical or electronic signature.

## What maintainers will do

Upon receiving a facially valid notice, maintainers will:

1. Acknowledge receipt.
2. Remove or disable access to the identified material (as appropriate).
3. Document the action taken (e.g., in a private maintainer log).
4. Notify the contributor/uploader (if applicable) with a copy of the notice
   (redacting personal information where appropriate).

## Counter-notice process

If you believe your content was removed in error, you may submit a
counter-notice containing:

1. Your name, address, and phone number.
2. Identification of the removed material and its location before removal.
3. A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief
   the material was removed as a result of mistake or misidentification.
4. A statement consenting to the jurisdiction of the appropriate federal
   district court (for the relevant hosting provider) and that you will accept
   service of process from the complainant.
5. A physical or electronic signature.

Maintainership may restore the material if appropriate and permitted by the
hosting provider’s policies.

## Repeat infringer policy

Accounts that repeatedly upload infringing material (including Windows ISOs,
WIMs, extracted system files, or other proprietary payloads) may be blocked
from contributing.

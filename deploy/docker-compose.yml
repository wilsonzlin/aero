# CANONICAL: Edge deployment for Aero (TLS termination + COOP/COEP/CSP security headers).
# Root-level compose files are service-specific examples; see `deploy/README.md`.

name: aero

services:
  # Reverse proxy / TLS terminator.
  #
  # Responsibilities:
  # - Terminates TLS on :443 (HTTP/2 enabled by default)
  # - Forces COOP/COEP/CORP headers at the edge for SharedArrayBuffer + WASM threads
  # - Proxies WebSocket upgrades (e.g. /tcp) and HTTP APIs (e.g. /dns-query) to the gateway

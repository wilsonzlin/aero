# Minimal coturn configuration for TURN REST (auth-secret) credentials.
#
# This is intended for local development via docker-compose's `with-turn-rest`
# profile. It intentionally does NOT embed a shared secret; docker-compose passes
# `--static-auth-secret` at runtime.
#
# IMPORTANT (NAT / Docker):
# - TURN must advertise an address reachable by browsers.
# - For local dev, external-ip=127.0.0.1 is typically fine (browser on same host).
# - For production, set external-ip to your public IP/hostname (or use 1:1 NAT config).

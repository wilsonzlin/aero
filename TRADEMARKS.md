# Trademark & Branding Guidelines

This document is not legal advice. Its goal is to reduce confusion and avoid
implying affiliation with Microsoft or other trademark owners.

## Microsoft trademarks

Microsoft, Windows, Windows 7, and related marks are trademarks of Microsoft
Corporation. Aero is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by
Microsoft.

## Allowed (generally “nominative” use)

You may use Microsoft marks **only as needed to truthfully describe
compatibility**, and only in a way that does not suggest endorsement.

Examples that are typically acceptable:

- “Runs Windows 7 (user-supplied media required)”
- “Windows 7 compatible emulator”
- “Tested with Windows 7 SP1 x86”

Best practices:

- Use trademarks as adjectives (“Windows 7 system”), not as nouns (“a Windows”)
- Include a clear **no-affiliation** disclaimer near any prominent use
- Avoid using Microsoft product icons/logos/artwork

## Forbidden / high-risk uses

Do not:

- Use Microsoft logos, product icons, or branding assets
- Name the project or a fork in a way that implies it *is* Windows or is
  officially produced by Microsoft (e.g., “Windows Emulator”, “Win7Emu”)
- Register domains or social accounts that look official or confusingly
  similar to Microsoft properties
- Use “Windows” as the primary brand name of your distribution

## Project naming guidance

Preferred naming patterns:

- “Aero” (project name) with a subtitle like “an x86 PC emulator”
- “Aero Emulator” / “Aero Web Emulator”

Avoid naming patterns that lead with Microsoft marks:

- “Windows 7 in the Browser”
- “Microsoft Windows Emulator”

## UI and marketing copy

Suggested disclaimer text:

> Aero is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
> sponsored by Microsoft Corporation. Windows is a trademark of Microsoft
> Corporation.

If you distribute a hosted service, also include:

> Users must supply their own Windows installation media and valid licenses.
> Aero does not provide or distribute Microsoft Windows.

# Cross-browser Playwright E2E runs are intentionally kept out of PR CI to keep
# pull request feedback fast. This workflow is run on a schedule, manually, and
# on pushes to `main`.
#
# NOTE: The Playwright `webServer` configuration is expected to start the app in
# a COOP/COEP (crossOriginIsolated) environment so SharedArrayBuffer-dependent
# tests can run in CI the same way they do locally.

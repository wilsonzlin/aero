# AeroGPU Windows 7 Driver Install (legacy path stub)

> [!WARNING]
> This file exists only to catch older links that referenced `guest/windows/`.
>
> The supported Win7 AeroGPU driver package is under:
>
> - [`drivers/aerogpu/packaging/win7/README.md`](../../../drivers/aerogpu/packaging/win7/README.md)
> - Staging helper: [`drivers/aerogpu/build/stage_packaging_win7.cmd`](../../../drivers/aerogpu/build/stage_packaging_win7.cmd)
>
> The old prototype driver stack (for the deprecated bring-up device) is archived under:
>
> - [`prototype/legacy-win7-aerogpu-1ae0/guest/windows/docs/driver_install.md`](../../../prototype/legacy-win7-aerogpu-1ae0/guest/windows/docs/driver_install.md)
>
> Note: the archived prototype is **not WOW64-complete** on Win7 x64 (no x86 UMD), so 32-bit D3D9 apps will fail.

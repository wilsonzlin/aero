# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Preferred reporting channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (private report), if enabled for this repository.
2. If Security Advisories are not enabled, contact the maintainers via GitHub (without including sensitive details) to arrange a secure channel.

Include:

- A description of the vulnerability and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Affected versions/commit hash (if known)
- Any suggested mitigation

## Response expectations

Maintainers will aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt within a reasonable time
- Work with the reporter to validate the issue
- Coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline

## Supported versions

Until the project has tagged releases, only the `main` branch is considered
supported for security fixes.

## Contributor security hygiene

For contributor-focused guidance (handling secrets, responding to leaks, and triaging CodeQL findings), see [`docs/security.md`](./docs/security.md).

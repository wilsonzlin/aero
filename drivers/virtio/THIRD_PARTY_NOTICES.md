# Third-party notices (virtio Windows drivers)

This directory is intended to contain (or be populated from) the **virtio-win** driver project.

When Aero starts redistributing real `.inf`/`.sys`/`.cat` artifacts under `drivers/virtio/prebuilt/`, add:

- the pinned upstream version (tag/commit + download URL)
- the upstream license texts copied verbatim
- any required attribution/notice files from the upstream distribution

Until then, `drivers/virtio/sample/` only contains non-functional placeholders for CI.

# `inf/` - driver package staging directory

This folder is intended to be the **exact directory you point Windows to** during installation:

- Device Manager → **Have Disk…** → select the desired `*.inf`
- `pnputil -i -a <path-to-inf>` (Windows 7)

In a finished package, this directory contains the driver package payload:

- `virtiosnd.sys` (built output; copied in manually from the WDK build output)
- One or more installable INFs:
  - `aero-virtio-snd.inf` (primary INF; matches virtio-snd modern + transitional HWIDs; recommended for Aero)
  - `virtio-snd.inf` (legacy filename alias kept for compatibility; functionally equivalent to `aero-virtio-snd.inf`)
- One catalog per INF (generated by `Inf2Cat` and then signed):
  - `aero-virtio-snd.cat`
  - `virtio-snd.cat`

> `Inf2Cat` hashes every file referenced by each INF. That means `virtiosnd.sys` must exist in this folder before running `..\scripts\make-cat.cmd`.

## Notes

- If you keep both INFs in this directory, `Inf2Cat` will generate **both** catalogs and `..\scripts\sign-driver.cmd` will sign **both**.
- If you only want to ship one driver package variant, remove the other INF before generating catalogs/signing so you end up with a minimal payload.

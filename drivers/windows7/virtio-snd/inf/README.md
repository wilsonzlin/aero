# `inf/` - driver package staging directory

This folder is intended to be the **exact directory you point Windows to** during installation:

- Device Manager → **Have Disk…** → select the desired `*.inf`
- `pnputil -i -a <path-to-inf>` (Windows 7)

In a finished package, this directory contains the driver package payload:

- `virtiosnd.sys` (built output; copied in manually from the WDK build output)
- Installable INF(s):
  - `aero-virtio-snd.inf` (primary INF; strict Aero contract v1 match: `DEV_1059&REV_01`; recommended)
  - (Optional) `virtio-snd.inf` legacy filename alias (installs the same driver but also matches `DEV_1059` without `REV_01` and transitional `DEV_1018`)
- Catalog(s) (generated by `Inf2Cat` and then signed):
  - `aero-virtio-snd.cat`
  - (Optional) `virtio-snd.cat` if `virtio-snd.inf` is present

> `Inf2Cat` hashes every file referenced by each INF. That means `virtiosnd.sys` must exist in this folder before running `..\scripts\make-cat.cmd`.

## Notes

- The legacy alias INF is checked in as `virtio-snd.inf.disabled` to avoid accidentally shipping/installing **two**
  INFs that match the same HWIDs.

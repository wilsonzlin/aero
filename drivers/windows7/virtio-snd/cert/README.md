# `cert/` (local-only)

This directory is used for **development test-signing artifacts** generated by:

- `..\scripts\make-cert.ps1`

Expected outputs:

```text
cert\aero-virtio-snd-test.cer   (public certificate to install on test machines)
cert\aero-virtio-snd-test.pfx   (private key; used by signtool)
```

Both files are intentionally **ignored by git** via `cert/.gitignore`.

> Treat `.pfx` files like secrets/private keys. Do not commit them, and avoid sharing them outside your dev/test environment.

## SHA-1 vs SHA-2

For maximum compatibility with stock Windows 7 SP1, `..\scripts\make-cert.ps1` attempts to generate a **SHA-1-signed** certificate by default.
If you opt into SHA-2 (`-AllowSha2CertFallback`), ensure the test machine has SHA-2 support updates installed (KB3033929 / KB4474419).

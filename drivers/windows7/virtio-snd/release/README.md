# Aero virtio-snd (Windows 7) release packaging

`../scripts/package-release.ps1` creates a deterministic ZIP containing the driver package payload files from `../inf/`.

The intent is that `inf/` contains exactly what you would provide to Device Manager (“Have Disk…”):

- `virtio-snd.inf`
- `virtio-snd.cat` (optional; generated by `Inf2Cat`)
- `virtiosnd.sys` (built output; copied into `inf/`)
- Any additional driver package payload files you add later (for example, coinstallers)

## Usage

From the repository root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File drivers/windows7/virtio-snd/scripts/package-release.ps1 `
  -OutDir drivers/windows7/virtio-snd/release/out
```

Generated `release/out/` and `*.zip` files are ignored by git (see `release/.gitignore`).

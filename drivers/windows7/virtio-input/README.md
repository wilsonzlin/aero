# Deprecated: moved to `drivers/windows/virtio-input/`

This directory is kept only as a **historical redirect**.

The canonical virtio-input Windows 7 driver source (INF + project + tests/tools) lives at:

- `drivers/windows/virtio-input/`

This directory intentionally contains **no driver INF** and **no buildable driver project**
to avoid accidentally shipping duplicate INFs/HWIDs.

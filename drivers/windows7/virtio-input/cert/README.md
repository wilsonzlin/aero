# `cert/` (local-only)

This directory is used for **development test-signing artifacts** generated by:

- `..\scripts\make-cert.ps1`

Expected outputs:

```text
cert\aero-virtio-input-test.cer   (public certificate to install on test machines)
cert\aero-virtio-input-test.pfx   (private key; used by signtool)
```

Both files are intentionally **ignored by git** via `cert/.gitignore`.

> Treat `.pfx` files like secrets/private keys. Do not commit them, and avoid sharing them outside your dev/test environment.

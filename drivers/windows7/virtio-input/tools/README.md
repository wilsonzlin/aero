# `tools/` (placeholder)

This directory is reserved for future **user-mode** utilities used to validate/debug the virtio-input driver.

Examples of what may live here later:

- HID report dump / sanity checking tools
- virtio-input event generator (for synthetic testing)
- Device interface enumerators / diagnostics

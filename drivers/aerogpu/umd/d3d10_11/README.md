# AeroGPU Windows 7 D3D10/11 User-Mode Driver (UMD)

This directory contains the **Direct3D 10 / Direct3D 11 Windows 7 SP1 user-mode driver** for AeroGPU.

The UMD is responsible for translating the D3D10DDI/D3D11DDI calls made by the D3D runtime into the **AeroGPU command stream** defined in `drivers/aerogpu/protocol/`.

This UMD targets only the **command stream** ABI (`drivers/aerogpu/protocol/aerogpu_cmd.h`). The kernel-mode driver (KMD) owns the submission transport and supports both the versioned (`aerogpu_pci.h` + `aerogpu_ring.h`) and legacy (`aerogpu_protocol.h`) device ABIs, auto-detected via MMIO magic; see `drivers/aerogpu/kmd/README.md`.

## Status / scope (initial)

This implementation is intentionally conservative and targets **the minimum functionality needed for a basic D3D11 triangle**:

- Device + immediate context
- Buffers and 2D textures
- Vertex/pixel shaders (DXBC payload passthrough)
- Input layout + vertex/index buffers
- RTV + clear + draw/draw-indexed
- Blend/raster/depth state objects (accepted; currently conservative/stubbed)
- Windowed swapchain present (sync interval 0/1) via `AEROGPU_CMD_PRESENT`

Unsupported functionality must fail cleanly (returning `E_NOTIMPL` / `E_INVALIDARG`) rather than crashing or dereferencing null DDI function pointers.

For a full “bring-up spec” (Win7 driver model overview, minimal D3D10DDI/D3D11DDI entrypoints to implement, swapchain behavior expectations, shader handling, and a test plan), see:

- `docs/graphics/win7-d3d10-11-umd-minimal.md`

## Feature level strategy

The initial feature claim is **D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_10_0**:

- D3D11 runtime compatibility (can create a D3D11 device at FL10_0)
- Avoids implementing SM5.0-only features (tessellation/CS/etc.) early
- Matches the minimal pipeline required for a triangle sample

## Command stream mapping

This UMD emits `drivers/aerogpu/protocol/aerogpu_cmd.h` packets and references objects using **protocol resource handles** (`aerogpu_handle_t`), not an “allocation list index” model:

- Packets reference resources via `resource_handle` / `buffer_handle` / `texture_handle` fields.
- When a resource is backed by guest memory, create packets may set `backing_alloc_id` (and `backing_offset_bytes`). Resolving `backing_alloc_id` requires sideband information from the KMD (planned via the optional per-submission `aerogpu_alloc_table` in the versioned ring ABI; the current bring-up UMD uses host-allocated resources and sets `backing_alloc_id = 0`).
- `aerogpu_handle_t` values are protocol object IDs; they are intentionally **not** WDDM allocation handles/IDs.

The core emission happens in `src/aerogpu_d3d10_11_umd.cpp` by building a linear command buffer consisting of:

```
[aerogpu_cmd_stream_header]
  [aerogpu_cmd_hdr + packet fields (+ payload...)]
  [aerogpu_cmd_hdr + packet fields (+ payload...)]
  ...
```

### Shared surface note

DXGI/D3D10/11 shared resource interop is not implemented in this UMD yet. The protocol supports it (primarily for D3D9Ex/DWM) via `AEROGPU_CMD_EXPORT_SHARED_SURFACE` / `AEROGPU_CMD_IMPORT_SHARED_SURFACE` and a stable cross-process `share_token` (generated by the UMD and stored in preserved WDDM allocation private data; see `drivers/aerogpu/protocol/aerogpu_wddm_alloc.h`).

## Build

This code is intended to be built as a **DLL UMD** for Windows 7 SP1.

Build files provided:

- `aerogpu_d3d10_11.sln`
- `aerogpu_d3d10_11.vcxproj` (Win32 + x64)

The project is configured to output binaries that match the Win7 packaging INF:

- Win32: `aerogpu_d3d10.dll`
- x64: `aerogpu_d3d10_x64.dll`

### Exported entrypoints

The Win7 D3D10/D3D11 runtimes load the UMD and look up these exports by name:

- `OpenAdapter10`
- `OpenAdapter10_2`
- `OpenAdapter11`

On Win32, `__stdcall` would normally decorate the symbol names (for example,
`_OpenAdapter10@4`). The build uses module-definition files to ensure the DLL
exports the undecorated names expected by the runtimes:

- `aerogpu_d3d10_x86.def`
- `aerogpu_d3d10_x64.def`

Recommended build entrypoint (MSBuild/WDK10):

```cmd
cd \path\to\repo
msbuild drivers\aerogpu\aerogpu.sln /m /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=Win32
msbuild drivers\aerogpu\aerogpu.sln /m /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

CI builds the same solution (and stages outputs under `out/drivers/aerogpu/`) via `ci/build-drivers.ps1`.
If your checkout still contains `drivers\aerogpu\build\build_all.cmd`, treat it as a convenience wrapper around MSBuild/WDK10 that stages outputs under `drivers\aerogpu\build\out\win7\...`.

The project expects the Windows SDK/WDK to provide D3D10/11 DDI headers (e.g. `d3d10umddi.h`, `d3d11umddi.h`) when building the real UMD.

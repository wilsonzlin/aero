# Legacy AeroGPU protocol headers

The headers in this directory define the **deprecated** AeroGPU bring-up ABI that existed
before the split, versioned protocol (`aerogpu_pci.h`, `aerogpu_ring.h`, `aerogpu_cmd.h`).

This legacy ABI is kept only to support older guest driver stacks and should not be used
for new development.

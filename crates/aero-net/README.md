# `aero-net` (retired)

This directory used to contain the original Tokio-era in-browser networking stack implementation.

It has been **retired** in favor of the maintained networking stacks:

- `crates/aero-net-stack` (Phase 0 in-browser slirp/NAT stack)
- `crates/aero-l2-proxy` (Option C L2-tunnel proxy stack)

The legacy `aero-net` implementation is no longer part of the Rust workspace and is not built in CI.

# End-to-end test plans

This directory contains **single-document, end-to-end** test plans that tie together:

- the Rust device model (host-side conformance tests),
- guest drivers (Windows 7 bring-up + automated harness), and
- browser/web runtime validation (routing + integration checks).

These are intended to be copy/paste-friendly “do these steps” docs that a contributor can follow without reading source code.

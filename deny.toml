# cargo-deny configuration
#
# Policy intent:
# - Keep Aero's dependency graph compatible with permissive licensing (MIT/Apache-2.0 dual-license friendly).
# - Reject copyleft dependencies (e.g. GPL/LGPL/AGPL) by omission from the allow list.
#   NOTE: cargo-deny removed the old `licenses.deny` key; a strict allow list is the
#   supported way to keep copyleft out.
# - Reject non-crates.io sources (unknown registries / git deps) unless explicitly allowlisted.
#   NOTE: `cargo deny check sources` lints registries and git sources; path dependencies
#   are local to the repo/workspace and aren't covered by the sources check.
#
# Docs context: see `docs/13-legal-considerations.md` (license compatibility and audits).

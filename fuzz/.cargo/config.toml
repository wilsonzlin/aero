# `cargo-fuzz` requires nightly-only `-Zsanitizer=...` flags. In some CI/sandbox
# environments `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` is forced to stable, which would otherwise make
# `cargo fuzz run` fail even though `fuzz/rust-toolchain.toml` exists.
#
# Force Cargo builds in this crate to use a nightly `rustc` via a tiny wrapper.

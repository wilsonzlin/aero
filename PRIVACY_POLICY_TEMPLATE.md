This Privacy Policy describes how `<SERVICE_NAME>` (“we”, “us”) collects, uses,
and shares information when you access the service at `<SERVICE_URL>`.

## Summary

- We aim to run the emulator locally in your browser.
- Users must provide their own Windows installation media and licenses.
- This policy must accurately describe whether any files (disk images, ISOs,
  logs, crash reports) are uploaded to servers.

## Information we collect

### Information you provide

- **Account information** (if accounts exist): email address, username, etc.
- **Support requests**: information you include when contacting us.
- **User-provided files** (only if the service uploads them): disk images,
  ISOs, or other files you choose to provide.

### Information collected automatically

- **Usage data**: pages viewed, feature usage, timestamps.
- **Device/browser data**: user agent, OS, approximate locale.
- **Diagnostics**: crash reports and performance metrics (if enabled).
- **IP address**: typically collected by servers as part of normal operation.

### Cookies / local storage

Describe any cookies or local storage used for:

- Session management
- Preferences
- Analytics

If the emulator stores state locally (e.g., OPFS/IndexedDB), describe what is
stored and how to clear it.

## How we use information

We use information to:

- Provide and maintain the service

We may share information with:

- Service providers (hosting, analytics) acting on our behalf

If user-provided files are uploaded, describe:

- Where they are stored
- Who can access them
- Whether they are encrypted at rest/in transit

## Data retention

Describe retention periods for:

- Account data
- Server logs
- Uploaded files (if any)

## Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data.
However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Your choices

Describe how users can:

- Access, update, or delete account data
- Opt out of analytics (if applicable)
- Delete local emulator state (e.g., clear site data)
